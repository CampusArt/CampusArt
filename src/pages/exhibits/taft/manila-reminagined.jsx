        <p>The idea of producing an exhibit on Daniel Burnham and his plan for Manila has been a long-standing dream between me and Jim Caumeron. Both architects and faculty of Benilde’s architecture program, we had been toying with this idea of letting our students revisit the vision of Burnham more than a hundred years ago. Jim in fact assigned Burnham in one of his design classes. Our goal for this project is hoping that in the students’ investigation of Burnham’s plan, they will look more deeply into his vision, discover what was of value, and possibly apply its lessons today. The Manila of 1904, when Burnham first visited, is a distant version of the city today. It has gone through cataclysmic episodes in its history, notably the devastation of World War 2 and the hurried process of its reconstruction. The post-war years have not been kind either, when it was abandoned, unplanned, and abused.</p>
