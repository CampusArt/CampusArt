            <p>In 1905, the architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham presented his plan for Manila to the Philippine Commission. The Philippines was then a colony under America, established when the United States won the country over Spain on May 1, 1898 at the Battle of Manila Bay. </p>
            <p>The urban plan Burnham presented featured, among others, a government center facing a large park, radial roads that connected opposite parts of the city, and the development of a seaside boulevard. It was to be an American vision of a modern, 20thC city, patterned after the principles of the City Beautiful movement, which Burnham espoused.</p>

              Daniel Hudson Burnham was an American architect and urban planner. He was born on September 4, 1846 in New York but later moved with his family to Chicago where he did most of his schooling. In 1870, after living in other cities, Burnham returned to Chicago to establish his practice. Some of Burnham’s projects included the 10-storey Montauk Block (1882–83,) said to be the world’s first skyscraper, the Rookery (completed 1886,) the second Rand McNally Building (completed 1890, demolished 1911,) the Monadnock Building (completed 1891,) and the Masonic Temple (completed 1892,) the Flatiron Building in New York City (completed 1902,) Union Station in Washington D.C. (completed 1907,) London's Selfridges department store (completed 1909,) and San Francisco's Merchants Exchange (completed 1903.) Burnham created the master plans for a number of cities, including Chicago (1909,) San Francisco (1905,) Washington, D.C. (1901,) Manila (1905,) and Baguio (1905.) He died on June 1 1912 at Heidelberg, Germany at the age of 65.

            <p>In 1893, Burnham became the director of works at the World’s Columbian Exposition, a fair held in Chicago, Illinois, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s voyage to America. Burnham was responsible for overseeing and completing the construction of about 150 buildings on more than 240 hectares of land. The fair was also called the “White City,” after the imposing Neoclassical style buildings painted shades of white and planned to be surrounded by gardens and water features in a landscaped setting. This ensemble of Neoclassical architecture and sylvan parks impressed the millions of visitors who went to the event, which ran for six months after it opened on May 1, 1893. Among them would be government officials, urban planners, and architects who brought back ideas from the fair and  implemented them in their own towns and cities. Often noted as the inspiration for the City Beautiful movement, the World’s Columbian Exposition influenced the development of modern American cities of the 19thC and made Daniel Burnham a leading name in American architecture and urban planning. It would also influence his plans for Manila and Baguio, and subsequently, other cities in the Philippines developed during the American colonial period.</p>

            <p style={{fontWeight: '500'}}>The City Beautiful movement</p>
            <p>The City Beautiful Movement was a philosophy of American architecture from the 1890s to the 1920s that aimed to reform the cities that were starting to grow in the late 19thC. The impetus for reformation stemmed from the fact that these cities were beginning to suffer the consequences of over population brought about by high birth rates and the increase in migration of people from rural areas and overseas. The aim of this movement was to introduce beautification and monumental grandeur to cities with the belief that this will create moral and civic virtue among urban populations. The movement was originally associated with Chicago, Cleveland, and Washington, D.C. but was also instrumental in shaping the plans of Manila and Baguio in the Philippines by Burnham.</p>
            <p>The movement first gained ground in 1893 with the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Daniel H. Burnham headed the construction of the fair’s temporary city, known to those who attended as the “White City,” a semi-utopia in which visitors were meant to be shielded from poverty and crime. Burnham’s plans for the site incorporated the designs of architects trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, who paired the balance and harmony of Neoclassical and Baroque architecture with the aesthetic of Chicago’s buildings and cityscape. The landscape of the Columbian Exposition, which included lagoons and big green expanses, was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr., famous for his winning design of New York City’s oasis, Central Park, which broke ground in 1857. To not only enhance the city’s appearance but also help the flow of vehicle and pedestrian traffic, the City Beautiful concept focused on incorporating a civic centre, parks, and grand boulevards. <br/>
            The holistic and multipurpose approach to urban planning that was championed by Burnham and displayed at the Columbian Exposition remained at the forefront of architecture, landscape architecture, and design for many years. Its impact is still visible in many cities throughout the United States. -<strong style={{fontStyle: 'italic', fontSize: '14px'}}><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/City-Beautiful-movement" style={{textDecoration: "none", color: "#000"}}>https://www.britannica.com/topic/City-Beautiful-movement</a></strong>

            <p>In 1904, a scant six years after the Battle of Manila Bay, Willam Cameron Forbes was assigned by US President Theodore Roosevelt as the Commissioner to the Philippines,  now an American colony. A good friend of Daniel Burnham, Forbes had suggested him to William Howard Taft, then the Secretary of War stationed in the colony, as the architect who could be in charge of the construction of developments then being planned for the archipelago. </p>
            <p>Burnham and his assistant, Pierce Anderson left America on October 13, 1904, with stops in Hawaii and Japan en route to the Philippines. On November 27, they began their journey to the Philippines from Japan. While in the country, Burnham saw Manila and its outlying districts and spent Christmas in the mountains of the Cordillera, north of the city. Manila was by then an old city of nearly 400 years, with its center, also identified as Manila, the Spanish built Intramuros. Constructed in the 16thC like a Medieval fortress town by the Spanish colonial government, Intramuros by the 19thC housed the seats of power of the Spanish colonial government and the Roman Catholic church, and a community of prominent Spaniards and Filipinos. But by this time, it was also showing its age. </p>

            <p>Burnham and Anderson studied and observed Intramuros and the rest of the city, conducted surveys, made maps, met with officials, and did other preparations to finalize their design. They also went to the mountains of the Cordilleras, north of Manila to inspect a part of the region that the American colonial government was planning to turn into a hill town, much like the British did in Simla, India, to escape the oppressive tropical heat of summer in the lowlands. This development will eventually result in the city of Baguio. Burnham and Anderson departed for the States on January 16, 1905 staying a total of six weeks in the Philippines.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Like his 1901 plans for the Mall of Washington D.C. and the 1905 plan for San Francisco, Burnham recommended axial roads that would radiate from specific points in the city, traversing to its other parts by cutting through the grid system, in place when the Spanish were in the Philippines. Aside from the ease of travel that Burnham envisioned, he also proposed that the radial roads converge towards public buildings of grand proportions, in the Neoclassical tradition of architecture and much like the buildings of the White City of 1893. Other options would be the creation of fountains or monuments that would lead the eye towards enjoyable vistas.</p>
            <p>The municipal buildings were grouped at the western part of the park, visible to all, in hopes that their grandeur would elicit awe and respect for the American colonial government by the citizens and especially the Filipinos. On the opposite side would be the cultural and entertainment hub, made up of exclusive clubs and a world-class hotel. Next to it would be a large pier, able to accommodate the largest ocean liners of the time.</p>
            <p>Burnham regarded the water features of the city positively and recognized that their banks and shores are not just for transportation but as prime land for recreation and relaxation for the people. This included not only Manila Bay, but also the Pasig River and its esteros, small waterways that would extend snake-like into parts of the city. These esteros, long used by the inhabitants for transport of people and goods, he recommended to be rehabilitated.</p>
            <p className="quote" style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
            "The narrow canals or estuaries ramifying throughout Manila, with their almost stagnant water and their unsanitary mud banks, would appear at first sight to be undesirable adjuncts of the city. Yet for transportation purposes they are of the utmost value, and in spite of the serious problems involved in properly widening, bridging, and maintaining them, they should be preserved, their availability to the poorest boatman making them peculiarly valuable. The estero could be not only an economical vehicle for the transaction of public business; it can become as in Venice, an element of beauty."

          <p>Burnham experienced the climate of a tropical country when he visited the Philippines. The experience of the hot summers was undoubtedly shared to him by the Americans and this oppressive heat was the reason why a city up in the mountains was commissioned by the government together with the Manila plan. Eventually, Baguio was developed in the cooler mountains and quickly became a popular destination. Nearer Manila, Burnham recommended summer resorts to offer respite to the citizens be developed in Laguna and Bataan.</p>
          <p>In accordance with the principles of the City Beautiful Movement the landscaping of the White City included large pools of water, artificial features that were integral to the parks. Burnham did not need to apply this strategy of using water features in the park he designed for Manila, for he also saw that the city already possessed two natural water features, a bay and a river. He recognized that Manila Bay and the Pasig River not only were effective in mitigating the tropical heat but also useful for the public’s means of transportation and with the development of its banks and shores, into spaces for rest and recreation.</p>
          <p><em>"Manila possesses the greatest resources for recreation and refreshments in its river and its ocean bay. Whatever portions of either have been given up to private use should be reclaimed where possible, and such portions as are still under public control should be developed and for-ever maintained for the use and enjoyment of the people."  </em></p>
          <p><em>"If the use of parks as an architectural accessory has long been common, it has remained for the modern city with its immense and congested population to show the necessity of them as breathing places for the people. These parks are often of two types -playfields of moderate sizes in the heart of the city and large sylvan stretches located in the outskirts where more ample areas allow the laying out of beautiful walks and drives in the midst of a romantic landscape." </em></p>

            <p>There were numerous criticisms against the City Beautiful Movement, foremost of which was its belief that the beautification of a city, without considering the social and economic systems, would result in a moral and law-abiding citizenry. This blind eye to the other segments of society was in a way, applied to Manila. For one, Burnham’s Manila did not recognize and consider the need for middle-class housing and areas for the poorer population. However, the merits of the plan outweighed the demerits. The idea of establishing a large open space fronting the Manila Bay and allotting it for use by the public was at once a nod to the principles of the City Beautiful Movement, a response to the conditions of a tropical country, and a democratic concession. Facing spectacular sunsets, Luneta today, at 58 hectares, is one of the largest urban parks in Asia and is considered a vital lung of the city. Like his other city plans, Burnham grouped buildings into zones according to function, in a formalist layout surrounding an open space, as he did with the government center at one end of the Luneta and the cultural and entertainment cluster on the opposite side. Burnham repeated the radial pattern he favored for his urban plans in America and in Manila, saw these diagonal streets, superimposed over the existing grid patterns beneficial in the flow and movement of traffic from one part of the city to the other. In its creation of vistas that orientated to government buildings, the radial streets carried as well its role in developing civic pride. </p>
            <p><em>“Such an arrangement, he suggested, would be ‘entirely fitting for both practical and sentimental reasons; practical because the center of governmental activity should be readily accessible from all sides; sentimental because every section of the Capital City should look with deference toward the symbol of the Nation's power. In most situations, he contended, the planning of a town should be carried out [so] that a person may pass from any given point to any other point along a reasonably direct line.’”</em></p>
            <p style={{textAlign:"right"}}>- Thomas Hines in “Burnham of Chicago,” 1974</p>
            <p>One of the positive reactions to Burnham was that he appreciated what he found in Manila’s architectural character, in the streets and the houses of Intramuros and outside. He recognized the beauty of the existing Spanish-Filipino architecture and saw that a lot of its features were not only aesthetically pleasing but responsive to the climate and the culture of the people. Burnham thought that the 19thC bahay-na-bato (two to three storey stone and wooden houses) with its red tile roofs and overhanging second floor was particularly pleasing. He also appreciated the Catholic churches which dotted the city, and even the Spanish government buildings, stating that he found them interesting and useful as references to future building projects for the colony. </p>

            <p><em>"Most of the existing buildings were erected in Spanish times and are of a distinctly Spanish type. They were for the most part built of wood with projecting second stories. The buildings were commonly covered with beautiful dull red tile, and the effect of the whole is unusually pleasing. The roof which still further overhangs the buildings was commonly covered with beautiful dull red tile, and the effect of the whole is unusually pleasing. The old Spanish churches and the old Spanish government buildings are especially interesting and in view of their beauty and practical suitability to local conditions could be profitably taken as examples of future structures."</em></p>
            <p>- Daniel Burnham, “Report on the Proposed Improvements of Manila,” printed in Proceedings of the 39th Annual Convention of the American Institute of Architects (Washington DC, 1906)</p>
            <p>In his introduction of the 1905 plan of Manila, Burnham listed down five specific objectives: (1) the development of waterfront and location of parks and parkways so as to give proper means of recreation to every quarter of the city; (2) a street system securing direct and easy communication from every part of the city to every other part;  (3) location of building sites for various activities; (4) development of waterways for transportation; (5) summer resorts. Some would be realised and remain to this day, enjoyed by the people, like the Luneta and the boulevard, now Roxas Boulevard, after President Manuel Roxas. Some were not implemented or may have been but destroyed during the war. In the subsequent years, the Burnham plan would be altered by various governments and urban planners, beginning with the first President of the Philippine Commonwealth, Manuel Quezon.</p>

            
            <p>Burnham closed his Manila report with this now famous quote. "On the point of rapid growth, yet still small in area, possessing the bay of Naples, the winding river of Paris, and the canals of Venice, Manila has before it an opportunity unique in the history of modern times , the opportunity to create unified city equal to the greatest of the Western World with the unparalleled and priceless addition of a tropical setting." Burnham never returned to the Philippines but remained interested in the affairs of the colony through his friend, William Cameron Forbes, who eventually became the Governor-General. More importantly, he was instrumental in the selection of an architect who would be stationed in the Philippines and realise his plans. This was William Parsons, educated in the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and Yale University, and whose designs would prove influential in the architecture and cities of the Philippines.
